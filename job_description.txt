We work to scale the user experience for hundreds of millions of fans and hundreds of thousands of advertisers. This scale brings unique challenges as well as tremendous opportunities for our artists and creators.
We are looking for Data Scientists to join our multidisciplinary Advertising R&D Product Insights team. Opportunities are available on both our Ad Demand and Commercialization team, and our Ads Data Platform team.
