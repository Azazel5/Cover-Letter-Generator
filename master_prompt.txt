**Format:** A single, concise sentence.
[HOOK_INSIGHT_END]

[SKILL_ALIGNMENT_START]
**Goal:** Find the most critical technical skill in the job description. Connect it to a specific project or experience from the resume. Start with a strong action verb and expand into a full paragraph, explaining not just WHAT you did, but HOW you did it and WHY it's relevant.

[SKILL_ALIGNMENT_END]

[QUANTIFIABLE_ACHIEVEMENT_START]

**Format:** A full paragraph (maximum 3-4 sentences, approximately 60-80 words)
[QUANTIFIABLE_ACHIEVEMENT_END]

[CULTURE_FIT_START]
